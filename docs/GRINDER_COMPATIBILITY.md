# Grinder Compatibility Matrix

Compatibility guide for Smart Grind-by-Weight modification across grinder models. GBW (Grind-by-Weight) models excluded as they don't need this mod.

## Compatibility Overview

## Methods Explained

- **Screen replacement**: Replace existing screen with Waveshare adapter
- **Pin soldering**: Direct board connections ([Besson method](https://besson.co/projects/coffee-grinder-smart-scale)) + custom mount using [abandoned chute cover](../3d_files/chute%20cover/) as starting point
- **Custom work**: Full electronics research + mechanical adaptation needed

See: **[3D PRINTS](3D_PRINTS.md)** for a couple designs that adds a Waveshare screenmount for Eureka grinders that don't come with one.

## How to adapt this mod for a not yet supported grinder

Bringing the Smart Grind-by-Weight setup to a new grinder mostly means recreating the mechanical interface and ensuring safe motor control.

- Design and print a new 3D mount that secures the load cell inside the grinder without interfering with the chute or burr carrier.
- Integrate the SSR-40DA (or equivalent) so the ESP32 can switch the grinder motor safely, tapping into the grinder's existing on/off path while keeping mains fully isolated.

For a concrete wiring example, reference the [Eureka Specialita reverse engineering notes](docs/eureka-specialita-reverse-engineering.md) that document how the mod ties into the stock control board.
